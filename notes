HTML is for the basic structure of the website (e.g. the bricks & walls of a house)

For headers, use <h1> and </h1> (forward slash when closing the tag)
It will make the text incrementally smaller and you use <h2>, <h3>, etc. all the way to <h6> which is the smallest the header can go

To create a line break and/or extra spaces between lines, use <br> (doesn't need a closing tag) 

# ANATOMY OF A TAG

<h1>Hello World!</h1>
The h1's are the start and end tags
The "Hello World!" is the content

If I have a tag like <hr size="3" noshade> (horizontal line), the "hr" is the HTML element and the size="3"/"noshade" is the HTML attribute
HTML elements can use different attributes to change the settings of the element such as size, color, etc.

Not all HTML tags require a closing tag
Check the documentation to see if things need a closing tag as well as what attributes are available

<center> centers the block
